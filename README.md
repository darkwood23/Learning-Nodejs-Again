## Documentation for project-01
    This project contains the basics of using expressJs and ejs.
    I created a mini-message-board application which lets users see messages, add messages and view the details of messages for which I created 3 ejs pages and 4 expressjs routes.

## Documentation for project-02
    This project contains the basic crub operations for mongodb and also uses modules such as fs and multer.
    I created this Inventory application which lets users create categories for their items and add items within the categories, the users can also add a picture for each item hence where multer and fs come into play.
